#CT Scan

I've completed the development of a Computed tomography scan (CT scan) system. I've developed it using the SDLC process, OOD, OOP, and TDD.
This System takes images from a sinogram array and computes their Computed tomography output as an image with a size of 350x400 pixels.

Firstly, I've researched several articles, papers, and references.
Then, I analyzed similar systems and their functional and non-functional requirements. After that, I designed the system and data flow. Afterward, I implemented it using OOP principles. I've used Matlab for algorithm development and C++ for system development.
Finally, I've tested the system thoroughly using the following: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Black Box Testing, White Box Testing, and Acceptance Testing.
